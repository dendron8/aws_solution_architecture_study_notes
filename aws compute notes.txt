aws compute notes

ec2 placement groups
	partition placement group across availability zones
		good for max resiliency of computer layer
		instances across logical partitions no share of hardware
		large distributed/replicated workloads
			cassandra, kafka, hadoop
	cluster placement groups - single AZ only
		good for applications that need low latency high throughput or both
	spread
		small group of instances, reduce correlated failures (no shared hardware)

aws fargate
	serverless compute engine 
	use with ecs to run containers without having to manage servers or ec2 clusters
	supports windows nodes but only for ECS, does not support EKS

ssh connection to ec2
	port 22 needs to be open in security group
	is the instance up
	make sure username associated with ec2 instance emi is correct
	verify ec2 key pairs assigned to the instance

aws compute optimizer
	recommends optimal aws resources for workloads
		to reduce costs and improve performance
	machine learning analyze historical utilization metrics
	helps choose optimal config for three resource types
		ec2, ebs, lambda

application load balancer
	route traffic to target groups
	if all targets in one target group unhealthy, load balancer still distributes traffic across unhealthy targets
		aws auto scaling replaces unhealthy targets. alb does not. 

aws instance scheduler
	automates starting and stopping of ec2 and rds instances
	reduce costs by stopping resources not in use and start when capacity is needed

aws serverless application repository
	commonly used lambda functions

auto scaling	
	scheduled scaling
	insufficientinstancecapacity error with auto scaling	
		could be that limited availability in AZ. try purchasing capacity reservations in AZ of need

ec2 instance with root ebs volume and one data ebs volume	
	create an emi from this instance and launch, all data stored in ebs is preserved
	
amazon texttract
	machine learning service applies optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from documents

amazon transcribe
	service that uses deep learning auto speech recognition for speech to text conversions

amazon comprehend
	natural language processor derive insights from text 

amazon rekognition 
	image and video analysis 

amazon elastic transcoder
	convert media files on S3 into consumer playback required format

amazon forecast
	fully managed servicemachine learning to deliver forecast for any time series data sets

aws xray	
	use case: enable xray for lambda function, can collect and visualize interactions between lambda and s3 bucket
